#Ping

Here is a recap of what we did on friday at python group, as well as some info on the next milestone:

First we looked at how to solve an example problem on the pi using python.
We used the subprocess python module to run the 'ping' linux program to ping the adafruit server, and then some standard python to parse the output for the average response time.
This example is in the attached 'ping.py' file.

Then we looked at how to write a sample pygame application.

we went through this tutorial (http://pygametutorials.wikidot.com/tutorials-basic) and discussed application structure, as well as what each line meant.

Then we took it one step further and added some text to the screen.
This example is in the attached 'test2.py' file.

##Milestone Challenge
For our next milestone, we want to combine all these elements into one program.
So we want to use the code we wrote before to curl the server for the contents of the file,
ping the server and get the average response time, and then display all these results on the screen using text in a pygame application.

Have fun and please let me know if you have any questions!

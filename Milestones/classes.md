#Classes

Following today's example, the milestone for next week will be as follows:

Create a simple python application that will use at least one class, with at least one method that takes at least one argument (other than self).
Furthermore, this class should be defined in a separate file and imported into your main application (remember to use from myfile import *) 

The application can be whatever you want, and please bring in your applications next week so we can all share

This doesn't need to be done on the raspberry pi, you can do this in a text file on your computer if you'd like. Just run it the same way you would run a file on the pi (python myfile.py) if you're using a mac.

Please let me know if you have any questions! Here is a reference for using classes in python https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/classes.html
